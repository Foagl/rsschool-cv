## About me and my Goals:
#### In 2020, I am graduated university KhAI with a degree master of Software Engineering.
#### After training, the goal was to become a QA engineer, but due to life circumstances and lack of motivation, it was not possible to devote myself all day to teaching this specialty, to maintain interest.
#### In order not to lose my skills, I am  passed online courses of English and QA training 2 times per year. AT 2023 decided that applied programming (participate in the development process) is more interesting, while studied the JAVA language at the institute, but due to the high entry threshold and the popularity of the JavaScript language, i am decided to study this language now. 
#### After several years of work in another industry, where my priority was to earn as much money as possible, now I want to do business for the future and self-realization. Frontend will help me with this, where I can realize my ideas, find a company or even earn money as a freelancer
#### *My hobbies: Playing the guitar, hiking, riding on bike and search for interesting places.*
## My Professional Skills:
* Basic level JS, Java Core, HTML, CSS, MySQL.
* Experience on writing simple programs and algorithms on Java,C++.
* Experience working during training Jira, Git, Agile ( from QA courses and internships).
## My Soft skill:
* responsible.
* stress-resistant.
* diligence.
## Example of  my code:
### The task of the function is to get a word in the argument and check if it is a palindrome. The respons from function is return in the format true or false.
```
function isWerewolf(target) {
        const rexExp = /[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g;
         target = target.replace(rexExp, '').toLowerCase();
         let clearString = target.replace(rexExp, '').toLowerCase().split('').reverse().join('');
         return target === clearString ? true : false;
 }
       console.log(isWerewolf("Was it a rat I saw?"));
