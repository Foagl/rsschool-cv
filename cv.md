## About me and my Goals:
In 2020, he graduated from KhAI with a degree in Software Engineering. After training, the goal was to become a QA engineer, but due to life circumstances and lack of motivation, it was not possible to devote myself all day to teaching this specialty, to maintain interest. In order not to lose my skills, I took online courses in English and QA training 2 times a year. 2023 decided that applied programming (participate in the development process) is more interesting, while he studied the JAVA language at the institute, but due to the high entry threshold and the popularity of the JavaScript language, he decided to study this language now. Now there is a lot of motivation and interest in learning Front-End development.
My hobbies: Playing the guitar, hiking, riding on bike and search for interesting places.
